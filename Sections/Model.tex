\section{Model overview}

Notation. Plain introduction to the primal and dual models of both WTM and RCOT.

As we will describe later, the WTM and RCOT depend on the same underlying mechanism which is based on the principle of comparative advantage.
The most parsimonious formulation is the WTM/RCOT model presented in \textcite{duchin_2012}, where the primal reads as follows:

\begin{mini}
    {\bm{x}^{*}}{\sum_{r} \bm{\pi}^{\prime}_{r} \bm{R}^{*}_{r} \bm{x}^{*}_{r}}{\label{eq:IOT_RCOT_quant}}{Z_{IO}=}
    \addConstraint{\sum_{r} (\bm{I}^{*}_{r} - \bm{A}^{*}_{r}) \bm{x}^{*}_{r}}{= \sum_{r} \bm{y}_{r}}{}
    \addConstraint{\bm{R}^{*}_{r} \bm{x}^{*}_{r}}{\le \bm{\varphi}_{r}}{\quad \forall r}
    \addConstraint{\bm{x}^{*}_{r}}{\ge \bm{0}}{\quad \forall r,}
\end{mini}

and the dual as:

\begin{maxi}
    {\bm{p}, \bm{r}_{r}}{\sum_{r} \bm{y}^{\prime}_{r} \bm{p} - \bm{\varphi}^{\prime} \bm{r}}{\label{eq:IOT_RCOT_price}}{W_{IO}=}
    \addConstraint{(\bm{I}^{*}_{r} - \bm{A}^{*}_{r})^{\prime} \bm{p} - {{\bm{R}}^{*}_{r}}^{\prime} \bm{r}_{r}}{\le {{\bm{R}}^{*}_{r}}^{\prime} \bm{\pi}_{r}}{\quad \forall r}
    \addConstraint{\bm{p}, \bm{r}_{r}}{\ge \bm{0}}{\quad \forall r.}
\end{maxi}



While RCOT is a more parsimonious and general version of Carter's square COT model, WTM is more or less directly based on square COT in the case of a free trade world.

Describe the topics of feasibility and shared factors etc.

\begin{itemize}
    \item characteristics
    \item examination of feasibility criteria
    \item Lagrange multipliers
    \item justification of ixi/cxc tables
    \item differentiation to sector disaggregation
    \item altered calculation of measures such as total factor productivity (and possibly also of circularity indicators \url{https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13446}. I suppose that all of that would simply be scenario-based and, if not directly, could be derived at least when doing the WTMBT (not sure, though))
\end{itemize}

Describe how both WTM and RCOT are generally to be applied (scenario-modelling etc) and then actual published applications.
